    "### Decision Tree Classifer\n",
    " \n",
    "###### Reason for using this classifier:\n",
    "Decision Trees work great in situations where there are not many features, like the case of this dataset. The cost of prediction is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree this means that you only have to check the tree about 8 times for a 295 data points we have. Also, once The decsision tree is generated, it can easily be visualized and explained to a non-technical audience. \n",
    "#### The Advantages:\n",
    "- The decision tree can be easily visualized, which makes it easy to understand and interprete\n",
    "- They require little data preparation\n",
    "- The storage cost for generating the prediction tree is logarithmic relative to the quantity of data provided\n",
    "The Disadvantages\n",
    "- Decision Trees can get overly complex performing well during training but not during prediction - a situation known as overfitting. There are ways to deal with overfitting.\n",
    "- Decision Trees need to be rebuilt and can result in a completely new tree once there is a variation in the original data.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Classifier\n",
    "#### Reason for using this classifier\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are generally used in classification problems with high dimensional spaces. They allow you to specify kernel methods which can be used to produce better predictions by taking advantage of domain knowledge. \n",
    "#### The advantages:\n",
    "- Effective in high dimensional spaces - They could still provide good prediction when the number of features is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "- Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function.\n",
    "#### The disadvantages:\n",
    "- It could have poor performance if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples\n",
    "- It does not provide probability estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "These are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features. In spite of their apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously document classification and spam filtering\n",
    "#### The Advantages:\n",
    "- They require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters.\n",
    "- Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.\n",
    "- The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution\n",
    "#### The Disadvantages:\n",
    "- it is known to be a bad estimator\n",

    "\n",
    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
    "- What is the model's final F<sub>1</sub> score?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reviewing the experiment's result\n",
    "Based on my experiments carried out previously, I believe DecisionTree Classifiers is generally more appropriate based on the available data. To understand why, I will review the three models here in terms of Performance, Train time and Prediction Time. Remember, that one of our goals here is to use as little computation as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "The average F1 Score `0.782` across all training sizes. The training time increased linearly with the training size and the prediction time is negligible.\n",
    "#### Support Vector Classifiers.\n",
    "The average F1 Score `0.811` across all training sizes. The training time increased exponentially with the training size and so does the prediction time. This model does have a better f1 score but it takes the most amount of time to both train and predict\n",
    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "The average F1 Score `0.754` across all training sizes. The training time has no clear pattern relative to the training size, however, it is considerable low. The prediction time appears near constant, but it is more than the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would argue that the decision tree classifier is a better model for our data because it gives a good f1 score, get trained fast and also predicts data in negligible time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Decision Trees work\n",
    "A decision tree is a set of rules used to classify data into categories. It looks at the variables in a data set, determines which are most important, and then comes up with a, tree of decisions which best partitions the data. The tree is created by splitting data up by variables and then counting to see how many are in each bucket after each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you were playing a guessing game where your opponent has a secret answer, but allows you to ask true or false questions. He then tells you if the answer to your question is true or false. How do you find the secret answer in the fewest number of questions? Let us assume that the game is to tell you if a student passes or fails. Some of the questions you can ask are `Is the student in a rural or urban area?`, `Is the student on education support?`,`Does he have internet`, `is the student male or female`, and so on. The algorithm groups tries to create a tree. To find out if a student passes or fails, you simply start asking questions. Each answer gives you a smaller question tree or tells you if the student will pass / fail. The tree is constructed to require the smallest number of questions to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explaining the Final Model\n",
    "My Model's final f1 score is 0.8102\n",
    "To do arrive at that score, gridsearch showed that setting a maximum depth to 2 nodes and maximum features using the square root of features produces the best model f1 score."
